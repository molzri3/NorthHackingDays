## Challenge Description 📄

A few days ago, suspicious activity was detected on one of my machines. It appears that an attacker gained access and executed **PowerShell commands** to carry out their objectives. The strange behavior caught my attention, and upon further investigation, I collected **Windows Event Logs** that capture all executed PowerShell commands during the breach.

Now, it’s your turn to step in and analyze the evidence. Your mission is to examine the PowerShell logs and uncover the attacker's activities. Somewhere in the logs, the attacker left behind a **flag**. Can you find it?

## Objective 🎯

- Download the provided **EVTX file** containing PowerShell execution logs.
- Use your **DFIR skills** to investigate and analyze the PowerShell activity.
- Identify the malicious commands and extract the hidden **flag**.
