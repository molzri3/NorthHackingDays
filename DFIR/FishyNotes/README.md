## Challenge Description 📄

A few days ago, I received a Word document from someone named **Fish**. The file was titled **"FishyNotes"**, and at first glance, it seemed harmless—a short note about some promised information. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse.

After opening the document:
- My PC started freezing and slowing down.
- Strange behavior became noticeable, and I suspected something malicious.

The document has since been isolated for further analysis. Now it’s your turn to step in and uncover what Fish was hiding inside. Your task is to analyze the provided file and **extract the hidden flag**.

- Download the provided Word document.
- Use your **DFIR skills** to inspect and analyze the file.
