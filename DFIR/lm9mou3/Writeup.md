In this challenge, we receive a mysterious file that refuses to reveal its contents. The file is linked to a well-known Moroccan artist often mocked on social media. Our goal is to recover the file and identify the artist and the name of the song, leading us to a specific geolocation based on an Instagram post from January 20.

## **recovering the file**

The given file is named corrupted.gif. However, upon inspecting its contents, it does not resemble a valid GIF file.

even if we try to use **exiftool** or **file** it doesn't give us a useful information about the file type

**So let's analyze the file header using a hex editor**
```bash
hexeditor Corrupted.gif 
```
