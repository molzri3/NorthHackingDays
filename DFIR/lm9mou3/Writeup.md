## **OverviewüìÑ**

In this challenge, we receive a mysterious file that refuses to reveal its contents. The file is linked to a well-known Moroccan artist often mocked on social media. Our goal is to recover the file and identify the artist and the name of the song, leading us to a specific geolocation based on an Instagram post from January 20.

## **Recovering the fileüßê**

The given file is named corrupted.gif. However, upon inspecting its contents, it does not resemble a valid GIF file.

even if we try to use **exiftool** or **file** it doesn't give us a useful information about the file type

**So let's analyze the file header using a hex editor**
```bash
hexeditor Corrupted.gif 
```

by checking this website **https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures** that provides a list of file signatures
we can see that our file header looks like a wav file header but it's a little bit modified

let's try to correct the hex values and save the file in a solution.wav
