## Challenge Description ðŸ“„  
A strange file has surfacedâ€”its origin is unclear, but it appears to be linked to a well-known Moroccan artist who is often mocked on social media. However, something is off. The file refuses to reveal its contents, as if someone wanted to erase its existence.  

Your mission is to uncover what lies within. Hidden inside is a crucial clue that will lead you further. But where does it point?  

On **January 20**, this artist posted something on their Instagramâ€”an ordinary moment, or so it seems. They were dancing in a lively district of a city famous for its luxury and vibrant streets.  

Not far from there, a mosque stands, carrying the name of an old Moroccan king. Find it. Identify its exact **address** to solve the challenge.
