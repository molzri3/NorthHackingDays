### Description :

In this challenge, you are provided with a **hardware-based encryption mechanism** that uses an XOR gate IC to transform data. Your goal is to **reverse-engineer the logic** and decrypt the output to recover the original flag.

A secret message was **sent through an encryption chip** in a simulated circuit, and the output has been captured in `output.txt`. Your task is to analyze the circuit, understand how the encryption works, and retrieve the flag.
**You are provided with:**

- **A circuit diagram (image)** showing the connections.
- **The original Arduino code (before encryption)** to understand how the flag is processed.
- **The encrypted output (`output.txt`)** to analyze and decrypt.
