### **Step 1: Checking the Audio File for Hidden Data**

Youâ€™re given an audio file called **`blaugrana.wav`**, but thereâ€™s something unusual about it. Instead of just listening, letâ€™s start by checking if thereâ€™s any hidden information inside the fileâ€™s metadata.

Run this command:

```bash
exiftool blaugrana.wav
```

This will display all the metadata stored in the file.

ðŸ“Œ **What youâ€™re looking for:**

- A **comment** field that contains a link to a Telegram bot `t.me/N2T_bot`

Once you find the link, open Telegram and start a conversation with the bot.

### **Step 2: Exploring the Telegram Bot**

The bot will respond with a welcome message. Now, type:

```
/help
```

This will show you a list of available commands.

One of the most important commands is:

```
/get_flag
```

However, when you try using it, youâ€™ll see that it doesnâ€™t work right away. The bot has security restrictions in place.

To get a clue, type:

```
/hint
```

ðŸ“Œ **What the hint tells you:**

- It mentions **modular arithmetic** and asks you to sum the ASCII values of letters in a word.
- It also refers to a very well-known number in Morocco (**spoiler: itâ€™s 212, the country code**).

At this point, you still donâ€™t have everything you need. Letâ€™s go back to the original `blaugrana.wav` file and dig deeper.
