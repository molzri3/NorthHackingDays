# Walkthrough :

### **Step 1: Checking the Audio File for Hidden Data**

Youâ€™re given an audio file called **`blaugrana.wav`**, but thereâ€™s something unusual about it. Instead of just listening, letâ€™s start by checking if thereâ€™s any hidden information inside the fileâ€™s metadata.

Run this command:

```bash
exiftool blaugrana.wav
```

This will display all the metadata stored in the file.

ðŸ“Œ **What youâ€™re looking for:**

- A **comment** field that contains a link to a Telegram bot `t.me/N2T_bot`

Once you find the link, open Telegram and start a conversation with the bot.

---

### **Step 2: Exploring the Telegram Bot**

The bot will respond with a welcome message. Now, type:

```
/help
```

This will show you a list of available commands.

One of the most important commands is:

```
/get_flag
```

However, when you try using it, youâ€™ll see that it doesnâ€™t work right away. The bot has security restrictions in place.

To get a clue, type:

```
/hint
```

ðŸ“Œ **What the hint tells you:**

- It mentions **modular arithmetic** and asks you to sum the ASCII values of letters in a word.
- It also refers to a very well-known number in Morocco (**spoiler: itâ€™s 212, the country code**).

At this point, you still donâ€™t have everything you need. Letâ€™s go back to the original `blaugrana.wav` file and dig deeper.

### **Step 3: Extracting a Hidden Audio File**

The `blaugrana.wav` file actually contains another **hidden** audio file inside it. You need a tool to find the embedded files within the original audio( steghide,binwalk..)

After crack just the password of zip file itâ€™s very easy to crack thereâ€™s various tools to do tha

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Try common words. The password is **"password"** (yes, itâ€™s that simple).

Now you have a new file: **`hidden_audio.wav`**.

---

### **Step 4: Decoding the Morse Code**

If you listen to `hidden_audio.wav`, youâ€™ll hear a series of beeps and pauses. This is **Morse code**.

Instead of decoding it manually, you can use an **online Morse code decoder**:

- Upload the file to https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder.html
- The output will be:
    
    ```
    VISCABARC
    ```
    

ðŸ“Œ **Important:** Remember this wordâ€”**"VISCABARCA"**â€”you will need it soon.

---

### **Step 5: Solving the Modular Arithmetic Puzzle**

The hint from the bot talked about summing the **ASCII values** of a word and using **modular arithmetic** with **212**.

Letâ€™s calculate it:

Open Python and run this:

```python
sum(ord(c) for c in "VISCABARCA") % 212
```

This will give you a **specific number** (letâ€™s call it `X`).

---

### **Step 6: Bypassing the Botâ€™s Security**

Now that you have the number `X`, go back to the bot and type:

```
/get_flag X
```

If you calculated it correctly, the bot will respond:

```
âœ… Payload = bypass_success
```

NOW you have the payload but as you already notice thereâ€™s some restrictions on the logic used by the bot to handle inputs of /get-flag so I will give u the opportunity to guess how to do it ( itâ€™s very easy now you should just type the payload in other format) 

Iâ€™m just kidding thereâ€™s the final step :

Thatâ€™s all see you next timeâ€¦. For those who ask what is this payload ask Mr GPT IM VERY LAZY TO DO IT!!
