As you can see in the picture to bypass the filters you will change those caracters by their equivalentes that's it !! 
The hint called Digraphs/Trigraphs.


Solution : 


%:include <stdio.h>
%:include <stdlib.h>

int main() <%
    FILE *file;
    char ch;
    file = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    printf("Content of flag.txt:");
    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) <%
        putchar(ch);
    %>
    fclose(file);
    return 0; %>
//add an empty new line and then submit
